        This is the best, and really maybe the only good, bagel in Portland. I have eaten a lot of bagels here and most of them are boring. Bernstein's reminds me of <a href="http://ordertalbagels.com/">Tal</a> in the Upper East Side, and I truly couldn't say anything more positive than that.

      This is the basketball I own and I think it's great. It bounces well and doesn't get flat ever. I love to play with this ball.
